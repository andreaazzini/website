Hello, world! My name is **Andrea Azzini**, a software engineer based in Milan, Italy. I graduated from Politecnico di Milano in April 2017, with a Master's Thesis called *Deep Learning Quantification*, an investigation about methods to extract quantitative information from pictures using convolutional autoencoders only.

I belong to the [Erasmus generation](http://www.garagerasmus.org/the-erasmus-generation.html), having studied as a Double Degree Master's student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I feel European as much as I feel Italian, and I believe in a global and collaborative world.

I've collaborated with the Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS) at  Harvard University in Cambridge, MA. Besides my thesis, I have been part of the first generation of the [Data-Shack program](http://datashack.deib.polimi.it/) and presented two deep learning workshops at the [ComputeFest 2017](http://computefest.seas.harvard.edu/).

I'm mainly interested in technology, science, music, football and politics, but  I'm a quite curious guy, and I tend to gain new interests over time.
