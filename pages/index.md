Hello, world! My name is Andrea Azzini, a Deep Learning Engineer based in Milan, Italy. I graduated from Politecnico di Milano in April 2017, with a Master's Thesis called [Deep Learning Quantification](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/133855), an investigation about methods of extraction of quantitative information from pictures of food ingredients using convolutional autoencoders.

I've collaborated with the Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA. Besides my thesis, I have been part of the first generation of the [Data-Shack program](http://datashack.deib.polimi.it/) and presented two deep learning workshops at the [ComputeFest 2017](http://computefest.seas.harvard.edu/).

I work as a Deep Learning Engineer, with a current focus on Computer Vision. My daily responsibilities include research, implementation and evaluation of deep convolutional neural networks. These models mainly aim at tackling problems such as image recognition, multilabel classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and so on.

My background and my job rely on strong Software Engineering skills among others. My interest in Computer Science is very broad, and includes areas such as artificial intelligence, functional programming languages, web development, and the list gets larger every week.

I try to open-source all my main projects. Feel free to have a look at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/andreaazzini) for more information about my work. I recommend you to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andazzini/) if you are interested in contacting me by any chance. You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andreaazzini), where I mainly tweet about Deep Learning, memes and football (soccer, don't be mistaken).

Cheers
